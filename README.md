# Quick primer: CORS requests

Recently most browsers have gotten stricter when handling requests from inside Javascript
that target domains different from the script's origin (the page executing the script).

This repository contains slides for a quick talk titled "CORS primer" as well as an
example how to configure CORS inside a SpringBoot backend.
